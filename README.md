## Interaction description
I chose User Input as my personal Task, which involves animating in conjunction with mouse or keyboard input.

1. **Mouse Movement**: Slowly move the mouse over the canvas to draw semi-transparent shapes (black graffiti, in my opinion). Press the "G" key to toggle this graffiti mode on and off.
2. **Clicking**: Click on the canvas to add a rectangle at the nearest grid position with a random color.

3. **Keyboard Controls**:
   - Press the **Arrow Keys** to add or remove horizontal and vertical lines.
   
      - **" ↑ / ↓"** means every press deletes / adds one horizontal line.
      - **" ← / →"** means every press deletes / adds one vertical line.
  
   - Press the **"G" key** to toggle graffiti mode on and off.
  
Since the code uses the noLoop function, it was difficult for me to animate another pattern while keeping certain patterns intact. So I chose a more minimalistic design solution.
